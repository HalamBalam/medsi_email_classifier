For example a movie can be categorized into 1 or more genres.\n","\n","#### Flow of the notebook\n","\n","The notebook will be divided into seperate sections to provide a organized walk through for the process used. This process can be modified for individual use cases. The sections are:\n","\n","1. [Importing Python Libraries and preparing the environment](#section01)\n","2. [Importing and Pre-Processing the domain data](#section02)\n","3. [Preparing the Dataset and Dataloader](#section03)\n","4. [Creating the Neural Network for Fine Tuning](#section04)\n","5. [Fine Tuning the Model](#section05)\n","6. [Validating the Model Performance](#section06)\n","7. [Saving the model and artifacts for Inference in Future](#section07)\n","\n","#### Technical Details\n","\n","This script leverages on multiple tools designed by other teams. Details of the tools used below. Please ensure that these elements are present in your setup to successfully implement this script.\n","\n"," - Data:\n","\t - We are using the Jigsaw toxic data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n","     - This is competion provide the souce dataset [Toxic Comment Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)\n","\t - We are referring only to the first csv file from the data dump: `train.csv`\n","\t - There are rows of data.  Where each row has the following data-point:\n","\t\t - Comment Text\n","\t\t - `toxic`\n","\t\t - `severe_toxic`\n","\t\t - `obscene`\n","\t\t - `threat`\n","\t\t - `insult`\n","\t\t - `identity_hate`\n","\n","Each comment can be marked for multiple categories. If the comment is `toxic` and `obscene`, then for both those headers the value will be `1` and for the others it will be `0`.\n","\n","\n"," - Language Model Used:\n","\t - DistilBERT is a smaller transformer model as compared to BERT or Roberta. It is created by process of distillation applied to Bert.  \n","\t - [Blog-Post](https://medium.com/huggingface/distilbert-8cf3380435b5)\n","\t - [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01108)\n","     - [Documentation for python](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html)\n","\n","\n"," - Hardware Requirements:\n","\t - Python 3.6 and above\n","\t - Pytorch, Transformers and All the stock Python ML Libraries\n","\t - GPU enabled setup\n","\n","\n"," - Script Objective:\n","\t - The objective of this script is to fine tune DistilBERT to be able to label a comment  into the following categories:\n","\t\t - `toxic`\n","\t\t - `severe_toxic`\n","\t\t - `obscene`\n","\t\t - `threat`\n","\t\t - `insult`\n","\t\t - `identity_hate`\n","\n","---\n","***NOTE***\n","- *It is to be noted that the overall mechanisms for a multiclass and multilabel problems are similar, except for few differences namely:*\n","\t- *Loss function is designed to evaluate all the probability of categories individually rather than as compared to other categories. Hence the use of `BCE` rather than `Cross Entropy` when defining loss.*\n","\t- *Sigmoid of the outputs calcuated to rather than Softmax. Again for the reasons defined in the previous point*\n","\t- *The [loss metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.hamming_loss.html) and **Hamming Score**  are used for direct comparison of expected vs predicted*\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-FA0wthINIsH"},"source":["<a id='section01'></a>\n","### Importing Python Libraries and preparing the environment\n","\n","At this step we will be importing the libraries and modules needed to run our script.
